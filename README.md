# Chromosome Conformation Capture
A variety of methods to analyze genome-wide chromosome conformation capture techniques, such as Hi-C and 3C-seq. 


## insilico_4C_celegans
This script will look in the two sets of chromosome conformation data produced by the Meyer lab (2015 and 2017) and export plots that show interaction counts with a specific region of interest (4C analysis). Chromosome conformation data has already been processed using the homebrew pipeline to produce a list of every interaction mapped to their fragment ends.
